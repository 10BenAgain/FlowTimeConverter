# FlowTimeConverter
This is a simple desktop application written in C# that is a functional copy of Blisy's FlowTimeConverter [tool](https://blisy.net/flowtimerconverter.html). 
Please go check out Blisy's [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@imablisy?si=3_Ux15KRTIc_OxpD)!

Yes, this project is messy. I am still learning how to write applications and this is my first attempt at writing a Windows App.  
I *know* its not optimized or clean and that is because I am new to software developement:)
